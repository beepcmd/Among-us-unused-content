New update: New Map Released – The Airship!

Welcome recruits. Hop onto the newest Among Us map – the Airship! Out now on all the Among Us platforms, this giant ship is where you’ll be able to work together to carry out the greatest plan... whether that’s as a Crewmate or Impostor is another question.

This free update includes:

The 4th map, and the biggest one yet
New tasks including jewel polishing, emptying trash (wow fun), and more
The ability to pick the room you start in
All new areas to explore (or get murdered in)
Improved mobility with ladders and moving platforms
Inspired by The Henry Stickmin Collection
Furthermore, an all-new optional skin bundle will be available for purchase! Check it out here and get fancy new gear to impress all your friends and enemies. Each new outfit in this bundle comes with its own custom kill animation! Not that you’ll need it. Since you’re not an Impostor... right? Right??

Features

Life as a Crewmate: Complete all your tasks on the ship to win, but watch out for Impostors! Report dead bodies and call emergency meetings to vote the Impostors out. Hope you chose correctly!

Play as an Impostor: Cause chaos, sneak around, and frame innocent bystanders! Winning involves killing off every Crewmate - think you’re a master of sabotage?

Customization: Choose how you want to play! Add more impostors, tasks, decrease visibility and more. And all in style as you get to choose your favorite color, outfit, and hat.

Cross-platform: play with your friends between PC, Nintendo Switch, Android, and iOS! Quickchat allows you to build your arguments and defenses quickly and easily during those emergency meetings.
